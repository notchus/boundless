# Boundless — Deferred Work

> A living checklist of things **decided but not yet done**. The point is that
> nothing falls through the cracks between sessions.
>
> When a decision is made that can't be acted on right now, it goes here with a
> **WHEN** trigger — *not* as a `// TODO` in code (the pre-commit hook rejects
> those) and *not* left to memory.
>
> **At the start of any session:** skim this file. If an item's WHEN trigger has
> arrived, do it or surface it. When you finish an item, check it off and note
> the date. When you defer something new, add it here under the right theme.

## Licensing

- [ ] **App Store additional-permission exception (AGPLv3 §7)** — add as a
      `LICENSE-EXCEPTION` file.
  - **WHEN:** before preparing the first iOS build.
  - **Why:** AGPL/GPL conflicts with Apple's EULA ("non-transferable,
    device-limited" terms). As sole copyright holder I can grant the exception
    (Signal's model).

- [ ] **DCO or lightweight CLA for outside contributors** — so licensing stays
      manageable as the project takes contributions.
  - **WHEN:** before accepting the first external pull request.

- [x] **Write ADR-0013** recording the AGPL-3.0 license decision and the three
      options weighed:
      AGPL-everywhere + exception / AGPL-server + Apache-clients / plain GPL.
  - **WHEN:** now-ish, via `/adr license`.
  - **DONE:** 2026-06-04 — see `docs/adr/0013-license.md` (Status: Accepted).

## Apple

- [ ] **Critical Alerts entitlement** — SUBMITTED and pending Apple review
      (1–3 weeks). Bundle ID: `app.boundless.rider`.
  - **WHEN:** watch for Apple's email; respond promptly to any follow-up
    questions.

- [ ] **Register the Driver app Bundle ID:** `app.boundless.driver`.
  - **WHEN:** when starting the Driver app.

- [ ] **Generate APNs `.p8` key** — note the Key ID + Team ID, store in
      Cloudflare Secrets Store.
  - **WHEN:** before implementing push notifications.

---

## Cloudflare / Infra

- [ ] **Create FCM service account JSON** for Android push; store in Cloudflare
      Secrets Store.
  - **WHEN:** before implementing Android push.

- [ ] **Store Cloudflare API token in GitHub Actions secrets** for CI deploys.
  - **WHEN:** setting up the deploy workflow.
  - **Note:** Not needed for local MCP — that uses OAuth.

- [ ] **Re-confirm the network allow-list (AC13/I8) as the web dep tree grows.** At T01
      the web tier IS now scanned: pinning `@simplewebauthn/server` produced a committed
      `web/pnpm-lock.yaml`, and `scripts/check-network-allowlist.sh` scans it (currently
      clean — no trackers). When T15 builds the SvelteKit app and `pnpm install` expands
      that lock with the full dep tree (SvelteKit, Tailwind, Vitest, Playwright, axe-core,
      …), re-run/confirm the allow-list still passes and tighten patterns if needed.
  - **WHEN:** spec 001 **T15** (SvelteKit admin web).

- **Cloudflare API MCP is authorized READ-ONLY by design.** Infra mutations go
  through Wrangler (human/CI gate), not the agent. If a task needs MCP write
  access, re-auth with Custom scopes for just that task, then revert. Never
  grant standing full access.

- [ ] **Fill in the TODO version numbers in `docs/stack-matrix.md`** with the
      actual installed versions.
  - **WHEN:** as each part of the stack gets initialized.
  - **Progress:** Rust toolchain filled (1.95.0) at spec 001 T01. `core/domain` deps
    filled at spec 001 T02 from the lock: `serde` 1.0.228 (+ `serde_core`), `serde_json`
    1.0.150, `uuid` 1.23.2, `insta` 1.47.2, `static_assertions` 1.1.0. Swift, Kotlin,
    TypeScript, Xcode, Android Studio, pnpm, and the remaining Rust deps (`uniffi`,
    `tokio`, `proptest`, `chrono`/`time`, `geo`, `petgraph`, …) remain TODO until those
    parts are initialized.

- [ ] **Re-pin `dryoc` to 0.9.0 (or the then-latest)** once it is *published* to
      crates.io. At T01 the stack-matrix's `dryoc 0.9.0` was found to be unpublished
      (0.9.0 exists only on the dryoc `main` branch); the pin was corrected to the
      latest published release **0.8.0** (MIT, MSRV 1.89, pure-Rust/wasm32 — same
      properties). 0.8.0 is fully sufficient; this is a "keep current" follow-up, not a
      blocker.
  - **WHEN:** when implementing `core::crypto` (T03), check crates.io for a newer
    published dryoc and bump if available; update `docs/stack-matrix.md` to match the lock.

---

## Spec-Driven tooling

- [x] **Spec Kit `/speckit.*` commands were not installed upstream.** Instead added
      local command shims (`.claude/commands/speckit.{plan,tasks,implement}.md`) that
      drive the same constitution-aware, subagent-based flow as the custom commands.
  - **DONE:** 2026-06-04. If full GitHub Spec Kit is later wanted, install via the
    `specify` CLI — but expect to reconcile its templates with the custom constitution
    wiring and the existing `.claude/commands/` set.

## Auth / Onboarding (spec 001 plan deferrals)

- [ ] **Three new privacy-invariant tests — implement WITH their code** (P9: the
      implementing test ships in the same PR):
      (1) `auth_refresh_rotation_replay_detected` — a replayed pre-rotation refresh
      credential is rejected and kills the session family (the sole control behind
      ADR-0016's no-forced-expiry decision);
      (2) extend the I12 forgetting property test to the new auth artifacts (phone
      hash + ciphertext, device tokens, sessions/refresh, outstanding Onboarding /
      Recovery codes, admin WebAuthn creds);
      (3) a named delete-leg device-token invalidation test, distinct from
      `i4_tokens_invalidated_on_reonboarding` and `…_on_logout`.
  - **WHEN:** implementing `core::auth` + `core::deletion`. Consider adding the
    refresh-rotation invariant to `docs/privacy-invariants.md` (with its test same PR).

- [ ] **Critical Alerts capability-upgrade path** — onboarding currently requests
      *standard* notifications (interim, spec 001 OQ6). Once the Critical Alerts
      entitlement lands, upgrade the rider doorbell path to Critical Alerts.
  - **WHEN:** Apple approves the Critical Alerts entitlement (see **Apple** section).

- [ ] **Admin WebAuthn verification host** — if the decision lands on a native Rust
      sidecar (`webauthn-rs` can't run in Workers wasm — `openssl-sys` C-FFI), that
      adds one always-on service to deploy/monitor; if it lands on edge-TS, no infra
      is added.
  - **WHEN:** resolved by the in-flight edge-TS verification → ADR-0017.

---

## Constitution

- [ ] **Replace `Ratified: TODO`** in `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with a
      real date.
  - **WHEN:** when you formally adopt the constitution.

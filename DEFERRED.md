# Boundless — Deferred Work

> A living checklist of things **decided but not yet done**. The point is that
> nothing falls through the cracks between sessions.
>
> When a decision is made that can't be acted on right now, it goes here with a
> **WHEN** trigger — *not* as a `// TODO` in code (the pre-commit hook rejects
> those) and *not* left to memory.
>
> **At the start of any session:** skim this file. If an item's WHEN trigger has
> arrived, do it or surface it. When you finish an item, check it off and note
> the date. When you defer something new, add it here under the right theme.

## Licensing

- [ ] **App Store additional-permission exception (AGPLv3 §7)** — add as a
      `LICENSE-EXCEPTION` file.
  - **WHEN:** before preparing the first iOS build.
  - **Why:** AGPL/GPL conflicts with Apple's EULA ("non-transferable,
    device-limited" terms). As sole copyright holder I can grant the exception
    (Signal's model).

- [ ] **DCO or lightweight CLA for outside contributors** — so licensing stays
      manageable as the project takes contributions.
  - **WHEN:** before accepting the first external pull request.

- [x] **Write ADR-0013** recording the AGPL-3.0 license decision and the three
      options weighed:
      AGPL-everywhere + exception / AGPL-server + Apache-clients / plain GPL.
  - **WHEN:** now-ish, via `/adr license`.
  - **DONE:** 2026-06-04 — see `docs/adr/0013-license.md` (Status: Accepted).

## Apple

- [ ] **Critical Alerts entitlement** — SUBMITTED and pending Apple review
      (1–3 weeks). Bundle ID: `app.boundless.rider`.
  - **WHEN:** watch for Apple's email; respond promptly to any follow-up
    questions.

- [ ] **Register the Driver app Bundle ID:** `app.boundless.driver`.
  - **WHEN:** when starting the Driver app.

- [ ] **Generate APNs `.p8` key** — note the Key ID + Team ID, store in
      Cloudflare Secrets Store.
  - **WHEN:** before implementing push notifications.
